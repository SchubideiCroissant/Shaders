\[
W(x, z, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i \cdot \sin\!\big( g_i(x, z)\cdot f_i  - \omega_i t + \varphi_i\big)
\]

- \(A_i\) amplitude controlling the wave height  
- \(g_i(x, z)\) spatial function such as a distance, a projection, or a simple axis 
- \(f_i\) spatial frequency controlling the number of waves (inverse of wavelength)  
- \(\omega_i\) temporal frequency controlling wave speed 
- \(t\) global time provided by Unity
- \(\varphi_i\) phase offset, optionally random for noise  

The displaced vertex is computed as

\[
p' = p + n \cdot W(x,z,t)
\]

- \(p'\) displaced world position of the vertex  
- \(p\) original world position of the vertex  
- \(n\) world-space normal of the vertex  
- \(W(x,z,t)\) wave function evaluated at the vertex position and global time
